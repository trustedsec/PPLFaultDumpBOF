# PPLFaultDumpBOF

Takes the original PPLFault and the original included DumpShellcode and combinds it all into a BOF targeting cobalt strike.

If you would like to run this in other projects please consider using our BOF runner implementation [COFFLoader](https://github.com/trustedsec/COFFLoader)

## Building

Normally I like to use mingw-w64 to build my BOF's but given that this expolit requires modern version of windows 10 to work, it was easier to convert and compile against cl.exe.

You need to start an x64 native visual studio developer prompt. Then from that prompt run [makebof.bat](PPLFault/makebof.bat)

## Code layout
The layout of this code closely matches the original, but the original solution files are essentially broken.  Start at [entry.c](PPLFault/entry.c) as that is the BOF entry point and where all other .h / .c files are included.

## Example Output

![Cobalt Strike Output](images/cs.jpeg)

## Usage
First load PPLFault.cna into cobalt strike
Then in any console run `pplfaultdump <pid> <outputpath>`
